# NextVIT_tensorflow

## Background

While working on the kaggle competition: 
[rsna-breast-cancer-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/overview)

I wanted to work on NextVit model : [arvix link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929)

But since it was on pytorch, I switched on tensorflow.
